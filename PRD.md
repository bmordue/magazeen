## Known Limitations & Areas of Ambiguity

### 🔴 High Priority Ambiguities

**1. Page Limit Enforcement Timing**
- **Issue:** Unclear whether page limit is enforced before or after adding content
- **Current Behavior:** Checked on CLI startup, but can be bypassed via programmatic API
- **Impact:** Users might exceed limits unknowingly
- **Recommendation:** Add validation in `ContentManager.addArticle()` and other add methods

**2. Session Management in Serverless Environments**
- **Issue:** Web interface relies on Vercel KV, but fallback behavior unclear
- **Current Behavior:** Code references both Vercel KV and "in-memory storage"
- **Impact:** Deployments without Vercel KV may fail silently
- **Recommendation:** Document required environment setup or implement robust fallback

**3. Concurrent Modification Handling**
- **Issue:** No locking mechanism for `magazine-content.json`
- **Current Behavior:** Last write wins, potential for data loss
- **Impact:** If CLI and web interface run simultaneously, edits may be lost
- **Recommendation:** Implement file locking or database backend for multi-user scenarios

**4. EPUB Reader Compatibility Testing**
- **Issue:** Claim of "95%+ e-reader compatibility" not verified
- **Current Behavior:** Basic EPUB 3.0 generation, but untested across devices
- **Impact:** May have rendering issues on specific devices
- **Recommendation:** Document tested readers and known incompatibilities

### 🟡 Medium Priority Ambiguities

**5. Chat Message Ordering**
- **Issue:** Unclear how message order is preserved from Claude export
- **Current Behavior:** Assumed to be array order, but not validated
- **Impact:** Conversations may appear out of sequence
- **Recommendation:** Add explicit sorting by timestamp if available

**6. Content Migration Strategy**
- **Issue:** No documented approach for schema changes to `magazine-content.json`
- **Current Behavior:** Breaking changes would require manual file editing
- **Impact:** Users may lose data during updates
- **Recommendation:** Implement version field and migration utilities

**7. Batch Import Behavior**
- **Issue:** When importing multiple Claude chats, selection state unclear
- **Current Behavior:** All imported chats set to `selected: false` by default
- **Impact:** User must manually select all after import
- **Recommendation:** Add `--select-all` flag or interactive selection during import

**8. Error Recovery**
- **Issue:** Partial failures during EPUB generation leave system in unknown state
- **Current Behavior:** No transaction-like behavior
- **Impact:** User may need to regenerate from scratch
- **Recommendation:** Implement rollback or checkpoint mechanism

### 🟢 Low Priority Ambiguities

**9. Content Deduplication**
- **Issue:** No mechanism to prevent duplicate articles or chats
- **Current Behavior:** Same content can be added multiple times
- **Impact:** Bloated magazines with repeated content
- **Recommendation:** Add duplicate detection by UUID or content hash

**10. Category Standardization**
- **Issue:** Categories are free-text, leading to inconsistency ("Tech" vs "Technology")
- **Current Behavior:** No validation or suggestions
- **Impact:** Poor organization and search
- **Recommendation:** Implement category suggestions or predefined list

**11. Archive Management**
- **Issue:** No built-in way to archive or version old magazines
- **Current Behavior:** User manually manages output files
- **Impact:** Risk of overwriting previous months
- **Recommendation:** Add archive mode or multi-month support

**12. Template Customization**
- **Issue:** Users cannot customize EPUB visual style without editing source
- **Current Behavior:** CSS hardcoded in `epub_styles.css`
- **Impact:** All magazines look identical
- **Recommendation:** Support user-provided CSS files

### Incomplete Features

**1. Pagination in Claude Chat Management (CLI)**
- **Status:** Partially implemented
- **Missing:** Full navigation (Next, Previous, Back) logic
- **Current:** Shows page 1 only, navigation placeholders exist

**2. Web Interface Error Handling**
- **Status:** Basic implementation
- **Missing:** Detailed error categorization and recovery suggestions
- **Current:** Generic error pages with minimal context

**3. Content Preview**
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Missing:** Ability to preview magazine before generation
- **Current:** No preview—user generates EPUB to see result

**4. Search and Filter**
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Missing:** Search through articles, interests, chats
- **Current:** View all content only, no filtering

**5. Export/Import of Content File**
- **Status:** Manual only
- **Missing:** Built-in backup/restore functionality
- **Current:** User must manually copy `magazine-content.json`

### Areas of General Confusion

**1. Dual Async/Sync APIs**
- **Observation:** `ContentManager` has both `loadContent()` (sync) and `loadContentAsync()` (async)
- **Confusion:** Documentation doesn't clarify when to use which
- **Impact:** Developers may use wrong method for their context

**2. `/tmp/out` vs `out/` Directory Usage**
- **Observation:** Generated EPUBs go to `/tmp/out`, content to `out/`
- **Confusion:** Why two different output directories?
- **Impact:** Users may look for EPUBs in wrong location

**3. "Magazine" vs "Issue" Terminology**
- **Observation:** Code generates monthly files but calls them "magazine" not "issue"
- **Confusion:** Is each file an issue of a magazine, or a separate magazine?
- **Impact:** User mental model may not match reality

**4. Content Collector Module**
- **Observation:** `content_collector.js` exists but appears unused (22 lines, no imports)
- **Confusion:** Is this deprecated? Safe to remove?
- **Impact:** Code clutter, unclear architecture
