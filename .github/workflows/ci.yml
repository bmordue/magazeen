          ## Code Coverage Report
          You can view the full coverage report [here]( ${{ steps.upload-artifact.outputs.artifact-url }} ).
          Coverage summary will be extracted and posted here if you use an action like `romeovs/lcov-reporter-action`.
          For now, please find the lcov.info file in the uploaded artifact.
          *Note: For more detailed inline annotations, a more specific coverage action might be needed depending on your test runner's output format.*
